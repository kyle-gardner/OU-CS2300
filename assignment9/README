run 
java -jar assignment9.jar {arg}

arg is a number, the length of the arrays you want to make (randomly)
for example 
java -jar assignment9.jar 10 
creates two random size 10 arrays and bubblesorts and mergesorts them

it then sorts it and prints them out. 
it creates integer arraylists but the class is generic so should work with anything comparable
